## **Key Improvements over Bitcoin**

### 1. **Scalability Enhancements**
- **Larger Block Sizes:** The block size has been increased beyond Bitcoin's 1 MB limit, allowing for more transactions per block.
- **Faster Block Times:** Blocks are generated every 5 minutes instead of 10, doubling the theoretical throughput.
- **Efficient Batch Processing:** Transaction batching and Merkle tree compression are implemented, reducing the overhead and improving the TPS (Transactions Per Second).

### 2. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**
- **CRYSTALS-Dilithium:** A quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm replaces Bitcoin's ECDSA for digital signatures. This ensures the blockchain's security against potential quantum computer attacks.
- **Merkle Trees Adaptation:** Post-quantum Merkle Trees verify block integrity while remaining computationally efficient.

### 3. **Improved Consensus Algorithm**
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** This replaces Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW), drastically reducing energy consumption and improving environmental sustainability. PoS also offers faster transaction confirmations.
- **Slashing Mechanism:** Validators can lose their stakes for malicious behavior, ensuring network reliability.

### 4. **Optimized Storage and Communication**
- **Compact Serialization:** Efficient encoding techniques reduce the size of stored and transmitted data.
- **Clustered Deployment:** Using Kubernetes and Docker, the project supports multi-node deployments with auto-scaling for high availability and load distribution.

## **Algorithmic Design and Functionality**

### **1. Wallet System**
- **Multi-Key Support:** Each wallet supports multiple addresses and keys, improving flexibility and security.
- **Transaction Signing:** Transactions are signed using private keys and verified with the corresponding public keys.
- **Blockchain Synchronization:** Wallet balances are updated dynamically by scanning the blockchain for incoming and outgoing transactions.

### **2. Consensus Algorithm**
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Validators are selected proportionally to their stakes, ensuring fairness and efficiency.
- **Slashing:** Misbehaving validators lose a portion of their stakes, maintaining the integrity of the network.

### **3. Blockchain and Network**
- **Block Compression:** Merkle root and transaction batching reduce block size, optimizing storage.
- **Broadcast Mechanism:** Nodes communicate efficiently to synchronize blockchain states.
- **Clustered Nodes:** Nodes are deployed across a Kubernetes cluster with Docker, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.

## **Clusterized Deployment**

### **1. Dockerized Application**
- The project is containerized using Docker, allowing seamless deployment across environments.

### **2. Kubernetes Integration**
- A Kubernetes cluster manages the nodes with:
  - **Deployment:** Automates scaling and managing multiple node replicas.
  - **Service:** Exposes nodes to handle external traffic via a LoadBalancer.
  - **Auto-scaling:** Ensures high availability by dynamically scaling replicas based on load.

### **3. High-Level Workflow**
1. **Transaction Creation:** Wallets generate and sign transactions.
2. **Broadcast:** Transactions are propagated across the network.
3. **Block Formation:** Nodes batch transactions into blocks and broadcast them.
4. **Validation:** The PoS consensus mechanism selects validators to append blocks to the chain.
5. **Synchronization:** Wallets and nodes update balances and blockchain states.
