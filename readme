## **Key Features**

### 1. **Scalability**
- **Larger Blocks:** Increased block size allows more transactions per block.
- **Faster Block Times:** Blocks are created every 5 minutes, doubling throughput.
- **Efficient Compression:** Transaction batching and Merkle tree optimization improve performance.

### 2. **Quantum-Resistant Security**
- **CRYSTALS-Dilithium:** Replaces Bitcoin's ECDSA to prevent quantum attacks.
- **Merkle Trees:** Adapted for post-quantum security.

### 3. **Energy Efficiency**
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Replaces Proof of Work, reducing energy usage and increasing speed.
- **Slashing:** Penalizes malicious validators to ensure reliability.

### 4. **Optimized Storage and Deployment**
- **Compact Data:** Efficient encoding reduces storage and network costs.
- **Cluster Deployment:** Utilizes Kubernetes and Docker for scalability and fault tolerance.

## **How It Works**

### **Wallet System**
- **Multi-Key Support:** Wallets handle multiple addresses for flexibility.
- **Transaction Signing:** Private keys sign transactions; public keys verify them.
- **Blockchain Sync:** Wallets update balances by scanning blockchain transactions.

### **Consensus Mechanism**
- **Proof of Stake:** Validators are chosen based on their stakes.
- **Integrity:** Misbehavior is penalized through a slashing mechanism.

### **Blockchain Architecture**
- **Block Compression:** Reduces size with Merkle root and batching.
- **Efficient Networking:** Nodes synchronize blockchain states through optimized communication.
- **Cluster Scaling:** Kubernetes ensures high availability and auto-scaling.

## **Deployment Overview**

### **Containerization with Docker**
- Ensures consistent deployment across environments.

### **Kubernetes Cluster**
- **Auto-Scaling:** Dynamically adjusts to workload.
- **Load Balancing:** Handles external traffic efficiently.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Maintains network reliability.

### **Workflow**
1. Wallets create and sign transactions.
2. Transactions propagate across the network.
3. Validators process transactions into blocks.
4. Nodes synchronize blockchain states.
